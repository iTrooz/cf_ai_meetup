I did not use many prompts to build this application, prefering to read the documentation and understanding the inner workings of the Cloudflare Developer Platform, but here are the few (Copilot) prompts I used:

```
Modify this component to add a typing indicator. I just want the frontend part of the typing indicator, with a small message above "Send a message". I'll then modify it to make it into another feature, I just want the frontend structure 
```

```
Button component tooltip does is out of the window and thus is not visible. Fix this
```

```
Add a button "change partner" in the UI which resets the state to "waiting_for_partner"
```
